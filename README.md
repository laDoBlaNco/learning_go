#LEARNING GO

I feel that Go is my future. Go is where I want to be. Ive decided to invest into the
Google languages (Go, Dart (Flutter)) and this repo is my path in becoming a Go expert. I've 
ensured not to place any copyright violating information into this repo, specifically for the 
paid trainings I've taken for certification, but these are my notes and thoughts around Go in 
general.
