	Here we are going to be getting into the data structures for Go. Arrays, slices, maps, etc
	Coming from other langs, the first thing most people notice is the LACK of data structures

Others (university CS students) also say that you shouldn't use arrays a lot in
your code, but Go has 2 arrays (Array & Slice) and the slice is Go's MOST IMPORANT
DATA STRUCTURE.
