	CORRECTNESS VS PERFORMANCE

	- Another issue with that when we write code we focus on performance first. When we do that, we are guessing.
	  We need to focus on correctness vs performance and then we can worry about performance later with all
	  the tools that Go gives us to handle this.

	  "Make it correct, make it clear, make it concise, than make it fast. In that order." - Wes Dyer

	  "Good engineering is less about finding the 'perfect' solution and more about understanding the
	   tradeoffs and being able to explain them." - JBD

	   We are always drafting code. We don't write perfect code.

	- Everything that makes us get our code correct in the end has to do with READING code.

	- Simple is usually better
	  "Problems can usually be solved with simple, mundane solutions. That means there's no glamorous work.
	  You don't get to show off your amazing skills. You just build something and that gets the job done and
	  then move one. This approach may not earn you oohs and aahs, but it let's you get one with it" - Jason Fried

	  If you want the oohs and aahs be a front-end dev. Back-end devs 'build air conditionars'. No one thinks
	  about the ac until it breaks and all anyone cares about is who is going to come in and fix it. If people
	  know who you are its cuz your code is broke.
