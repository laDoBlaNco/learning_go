/*	PRODUCTIVITY VS PERFORMANCE

	- Almost every swe will agree that performance is the most important, but in reality we put
	  productivity on the same level or more importance. This is what Go has done. We get the best
	  of both worlds with Go. We need Go that's 'fast enough', not faster than C.

	  "C is the best balance I've ever seen between power and expressiveness. You can do almost anything you
	  want to do by programming fairly straightforwardly and you will have a ver good mental model of what's
	  going to happen on the machine; you can predict reasonably well how quickly its going to run, you
	  understand what's going on..." - Brian Kernighan

	  You can replace 'C' with 'Go' above and its still hold true.

	- Go strikes the balance between Performance and Productivity! Before we couldn't really
	  have both, it was choosing one over the other. We naturally gravitated over to productivity
	  being more important and thus we have languages that focus on productivity (python, js, etc)
	  But this has also created sluggish programs that are outpacing the hardware's ability to
	  make them faster as we counted on in the past. Now with Go's idioms and a few guidlines, we
	  can write code that can be reasoned about by average devs, simplified that minimize the 
	  amount of code and thus the amount of bugs, and still be performant due to the mechanical
	  sympathies. We don't have to choose productivity over performance or vice versa, we can 
	  now have both. 

	  "The hardware folks will not put more cores into their hardware if the software isn't 
	  going to use them, so, it is this balancing act of  each other staring at each other, and
	  we are hoping that Go is going to break through on the software side." - Rick Hudson (2015)
