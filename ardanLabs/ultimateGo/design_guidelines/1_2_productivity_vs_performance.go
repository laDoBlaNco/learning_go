/*	PRODUCTIVITY VS PERFORMANCE

	- Almost every swe will agree that performance is the most important, but in reality we put
	  productivity on the same level or more importance. This is what Go has done. We get the best
	  of both worlds with Go. We need Go that's 'fast enough', not faster than C.

	  "C is the best balance I've ever seen between power and expressiveness. You can do almost anything you
	  want to do by programming fairly straightforwardly and you will have a ver good mental model of what's
	  going to happen on the machine; you can predict reasonably well how quickly its going to run, you
	  understand what's going on..." - Brian Kernighan

	  You can replace 'C' with 'Go' above and its still hold true.

	- Go strikes the balance between Performance and Productivity!
