	/*
		Explanation of the above by B Kennedy in Ardan labs:
		With the release of Go 1.2, slices gained the ability to specify the capacity
		when performing a slicing operation. This doesnâ€™t mean we can use this index
		to extend the capacity of the underlying array. It means we can create a new
		slice whose capacity is restricted. Restricting the capacity provides a level
		of protection to the underlying array and gives us more control over append
		operations.

		Taking a slight detour into the Ardan Labs blog with to understand the 3

	// here we only took the 3rd element, in face we can see that the address
	// of the third element is the first in takeOne. so working with same underlying
	// array. It has a len 1 and cap 3 cuz there 3 elements left in the underlying
	// array that are available to use.

	// What if we didn't want the new slice to have access to the remaining cap?
	// This is where [::] comes into play.
	fmt.Println("Slice of slice source with third index (Capacity):")
	takeOneCapOne := source[2:3:3] // use the 3rd index to set cap of new slice
	InspectSlice(takeOneCapOne)    // so we could append, etc without overwriting
	// the underlying array elements
	// if we try to make the new cap great than underlying array Go panics
	// takeOneCapFour:=source[2:3:6] // (6-2) attempts to set cap to 4 which is > avail
	// InspectSlice(takeOneCapFour) // slice bounds error

	// Now getting back to the slice tricks, if we append something to the new
	// slice that doesn't have access to underlying capacity?

	takeOneCapOne = append(takeOneCapOne, "Kiwi")
	InspectSlice(takeOneCapOne) // it works and under the hood as we can see from
	// the mem addresses, When we append an element to takeOneCapOne, a NEW underlying
	// array is created for the slice (space complexity). This new array contains
	// a copy fo the elements being ref'd from the source and then it is extended as
	// normal.

	// How is this different from not using capacity limit?:

	// So this time it uses the existing cap it has access to and overwrote 'banana'
	// So this feature as of Go 1.2 protects us and our data from unwanted overwrites
	// The more we leverage these builtin functions and runtime to handle these
	// types of ops the better.
