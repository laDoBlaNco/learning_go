func(method string, url string, body io.Reader) (*http.Request, error) NewRequest wraps NewRequestWithContext using context.Background.

func(ctx context.Context, method string, url string, body io.Reader) (*http.Request, error) NewRequestWithContext returns a new Request given a method, URL, and
optional body.

If the provided body is also an io.Closer, the returned
Request.Body is set to body and will be closed by the Client
methods Do, Post, and PostForm, and Transport.RoundTrip.

NewRequestWithContext returns a Request suitable for use with
Client.Do or Transport.RoundTrip. To create a request for use with
testing a Server Handler, either use the NewRequest function in the
net/http/httptest package, use ReadRequest, or manually update the
Request fields. For an outgoing client request, the context
controls the entire lifetime of a request and its response:
obtaining a connection, sending the request, and reading the
response headers and body. See the Request type's documentation for
the difference between inbound and outbound request fields.

If body is of type *bytes.Buffer, *bytes.Reader, or
*strings.Reader, the returned request's ContentLength is set to its
exact value (instead of -1), GetBody is populated (so 307 and 308
redirects can replay the body), and Body is set to NoBody if the
ContentLength is 0.
